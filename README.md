# ALX Listing App

## üè° About the Project

The **ALX Listing App** is a foundational project designed to scaffold the structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone emphasizes setting up a clean, scalable, and production-ready codebase using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**.

By following modern development best practices and a modular folder structure, the app provides a strong starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing interface.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the core folders used in this project:

##Project Structure (In-Depth)
This project is structured to promote scalability, reusability, and readability, aligning with modern frontend development standards. Here's a breakdown of the key directories and their roles in the ALX Listing App:

## components/
This directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the application. Instead of duplicating HTML and styling code in multiple places, components are created once and reused wherever needed. Examples include:

Card.tsx: A component used to display individual property listings.

Button.tsx: A customizable button used across the app for actions like filtering, booking, or navigation.

Purpose: Promotes a modular design system, makes code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and simplifies UI maintenance and updates.

## interfaces/
This folder is dedicated to TypeScript interfaces and types. These interfaces define the shape of data objects used across your components and logic. Examples include:

CardProps: Defines the expected props for the Card component (e.g., image, title, price).

ButtonProps: Specifies the props for buttons like label text, click handler, and styling variants.

Purpose: Enforces type safety, improves code intelligence in editors (e.g., autocomplete), and prevents bugs caused by unexpected data shapes.

## constants/
This directory is used for storing static configuration values or predefined data that are reused across the app. 

Examples may include:

Lists of filter options (e.g., property types, amenities).

Breakpoints or layout values for responsive design.

Status messages or error labels.

Purpose: Centralizes important static values, reduces magic numbers/hardcoding in components, and improves maintainability by making configuration values easy to find and change.

 ## public/assets/
This folder stores publicly accessible files such as:

Images: Property thumbnails, icons, logos, etc.

SVGs: Custom icons or UI decorations.

Static content: Any file you want available directly from the browser (e.g., /assets/logo.svg).

Purpose: Separates static media from code, allows easy referencing in components (e.g., <img src="/assets/property1.jpg" />), and ensures assets are included during builds and served efficiently by Next.js.
